        <p>
          Throughout <em>Genesis Alpha</em>, a common theme that is presented
          concerns evil within the narrator or surrounding characters. If both
          Max and Rachel decided to address their internal feelings instead of
          lashing out on other members of society, the whole conflict could have
          been avoided. Max, instead of talking with his parents or another trusted
          friend about his feelings of abandonment as a child after Josh's birth,
          his anger and rage may not have caused such an evil act to take place.
          Because now their parents are addressing the issue for the first time,
          Max isn't really open to the discussion and cuts them out of his life -
          he sees it as too little too late

        <h2>Character Analysis</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Josh Seville</span>
            Josh's actions were just in telling his dad about Max's character Rook,
            but he really should have mentioned Rachel earlier. Josh, at the start,
            is motivated by his beleif that Max is innocent, but as the story progresses
            he becomes driven to discover the truth about his birth and why he
            was created in the first place. Though I may end up doing something similar
            if I were actually in Josh's position, I would hope that my anger wouldn't
            get the best of me when dealing with somebody as messed up as Rachel.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Max Seville</span>
            While I don't really know why Max murdered Karen, something wasn't quite
            right in Max's reasoning - wether he didn't really realize what he was doing or
            was just insane. Max is, at first, described as being a nice person who
            seems perfectly legitimate in motives and desires. As the story progresses,
            we get to see how Max converts from this reasonable person, to someone
            who his own mother can barely stand. By the end, Max has changed to such
            a degree that he decides to throw his family under the bus just to decrease
            his prison sentence. That is a move that, in the end, shows how much
            he has changed from before he went to collage to after and how he feels
            about his family then and now.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Parents of Josh and Max</span>
            Even though I cannot speak from personal experience, both parent seem
            to over-react at every new little detail that is dug up by the media.
            They really should have slowed down and taken each bit of information slowly
            and mythodically. Some of the pain was inflicted by their past actions, like
            their hiding the fact Josh was a clone from him for such a long time,
            but other things, such as Max's betrayal, were out of their control and
            they shouldn't take so harshly upon themselves.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Rachel</span>
            Rachel, contrary to what an average reader may think, was trying to
            act rationaly. She was trying to get revenge for what Max did to
            her sister in the only way she could think how - by hurting a "seperate
            part" of Max. While in the end she dicovers that Josh and Max are quite
            seperate people (Josh can feel pain/angst toward others while Max doesn't)
            she took her rational feelings of revenge a little to far in trying to blame
            Josh for something in which he really had no part in whatsoever.
