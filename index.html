        <h2>Book Review</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="underline">Genesis Alpha</span>, by Rune Michaels, is a thriller that to many would be a riveting book. Josh embodies the
          typical teenager who is addicted to a video game, and has no life outside what he is
          doing within the game. This is very relatable, good choice for a main character, as
          many teens have similar feelings about video games. However, his life takes a turn from
          a typical teenager's everyday experiences when his brother is blamed for the murder
          of a girl named Karen, a brother that when Josh was younger was born to help save from cancer.
          Max's reaction is very typical of somebody in his situation - of sheer shock
          and utter belif in Max's innocence. As the story progresses, however, Rachel, the sister
          of the girl Max allegdly murders, gives Josh proof and helps turn allegdly into
          probably. However, because of his "gift" to Josh earlier in life, he's not sure
          if he is at all responsible - after all, part of Josh is inside of Max!
        </p>
        <p>
          Max, at first, seemed like a nice, responsible young man that was wrongly
          accused of a crime he didn't commit, but as the story progresses his true feelings
          are shown, which makes the reader question their previous judgement. During their
          second meeting, Max happens to make a comment that leaves Josh wondering what exactly he
          meant. This comment slowly leads to Max's discovery of a big secret, one that
          his parents had been keeping since his birth. Max and Josh are clones - as his mom
          puts it, they are just "twins born a few years apart, with some scientific help. That's
          all.", as Max puts it, he's Josh's reserve parts, if he were to become sick again. Issues
          like this make me wonder wether these kind of discussions will happen within my lifetime,
          and if "designer babies" will become the norm.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the start of the book, Rachel, the sister of Karen, shows her anger towards Max through
          Josh. At first, her tale is of a chilling person that Josh could never beleive to be Max. As the story
          unfolds, Josh learns that he didn't really know Max as well as he thought. As many belive
          there to be a connection between the two brothers, because of Josh's dontation
          to Max. Rachel's extorsion and pusnishment of Josh, on Max's behalf, made me not want to side with her in the
          first place. But, as her evil lashing-out for her sister's death to somebody who really did nothing continued,
          her actions made me dispise her. Rachel was one of the most evil characters I have ever read in a book -
          her actions toward Josh made me mad and forced me, more than once, to put down the
          book. However, as the story progresses, her evil becomes less intense and by the end the tense
          relationship has resolved itself. All in all, readers end up realizing that Rachel
          isn't quite as evil as was though from the beginning, and that her brutality
          was, though directed at the wrong person, justified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though I did finish the book, knowing what I know now, I wouldn't read it again.
          The tension between Rachel and Josh near the start of the book made me wish
          that Rachel would just go back to where she came from. As the tension between
          the two characters climaxed and started to resolve, I was releived. This book
          helps show that good and evil are both relative terms and the perception of
          a person's good or evil can change in a split-second.

        <h2>Theme Analysis</h2>
        <blockquote>
          "Attack the evil that is within yourself, rather than attacking the evil that is in others."
          <footer>Confucius</footer>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Throughout <span class="underline">Genesis Alpha</span>, a common theme that is presented
          concerns evil within the narrator or surrounding characters. If both
          Max and Rachel decided to address their internal feelings instead of
          lashing out on other members of society, the whole conflict could have
          been avoided. Max, instead of talking with his parents or another trusted
          friend about his feelings of abandonment as a child after Josh's birth,
          his anger and rage may not have caused such an evil act to take place.
          Because now their parents are addressing the issue for the first time,
          Max isn't really open to the discussion and cuts them out of his life -
          he sees it as too little too late

        <h2>Character Analysis</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Josh Seville</span>
            Josh's actions were just in telling his dad about Max's character Rook,
            but he really should have mentioned Rachel earlier. Josh, at the start,
            is motivated by his beleif that Max is innocent, but as the story progresses
            he becomes driven to discover the truth about his birth and why he
            was created in the first place. Though I may end up doing something similar
            if I were actually in Josh's position, I would hope that my anger wouldn't
            get the best of me when dealing with somebody as messed up as Rachel.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Max Seville</span>
            While I don't really know why Max murdered Karen, something wasn't quite
            right in Max's reasoning - wether he didn't really realize what he was doing or
            was just insane. Max is, at first, described as being a nice person who
            seems perfectly legitimate in motives and desires. As the story progresses,
            we get to see how Max converts from this reasonable person, to someone
            who his own mother can barely stand. By the end, Max has changed to such
            a degree that he decides to throw his family under the bus just to decrease
            his prison sentence. That is a move that, in the end, shows how much
            he has changed from before he went to collage to after and how he feels
            about his family then and now.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Parents of Josh and Max</span>
            Even though I cannot speak from personal experience, both parent seem
            to over-react at every new little detail that is dug up by the media.
            They really should have slowed down and taken each bit of information slowly
            and mythodically. Some of the pain was inflicted by their past actions, like
            their hiding the fact Josh was a clone from him for such a long time,
            but other things, such as Max's betrayal, were out of their control and
            they shouldn't take so harshly upon themselves.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Rachel</span>
            Rachel, contrary to what an average reader may think, was trying to
            act rationaly. She was trying to get revenge for what Max did to
            her sister in the only way she could think how - by hurting a "seperate
            part" of Max. While in the end she dicovers that Josh and Max are quite
            seperate people (Josh can feel pain/angst toward others while Max doesn't)
            she took her rational feelings of revenge a little to far in trying to blame
            Josh for something in which he really had no part in whatsoever.
